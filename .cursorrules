# Wonder Shuffle Project Rules

## Deck and Draw Limits (DO NOT VIOLATE)

**The deck size MUST NOT affect the maximum number of cards that can be drawn.**

- Cards are reinserted into the deck after each draw (drawing is sampling with replacement).
- The max number of drawn cards is always `DECK_CONFIG.MAX_DRAW` (20), regardless of deck size.
- NEVER cap the "number of cards to draw" input based on deck size (13, 22, or custom).
- NEVER suggest, implement, or revert to logic that limits draws by deck size.
- The 13-card deck, 22-card deck, and custom deck all allow drawing up to 20 cards.
